# Travel-Karo - Google map travel companion

Planning a trip made easy.  We can search for Restaurants , Hotels and attractions around us whenever visiting a new place. We can search for places before hand when planning for a trip. We can even sort places based on rating and locate them on a google map.
Each restaurant , hotel , or attraction comes with all the necessary information about it like it’s name , address , distance , reviews, images etc. It even contains a link which takes you to the official website.
This web-app uses frameworks such as React-JS and Material UI as its’s core and we fetch data using an API, which returns all the required information. It also uses a Google map component which displays all the restaurants, hotels etc.
